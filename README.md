# Vending Machine Controller — Verilog HDL

A hardware-based vending machine controller implemented using **Verilog HDL** and simulated using **Xilinx tools**.  
The system models real-world vending machine behavior using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a digital vending machine controller capable of:

- Product selection
- Coin and online payment handling
- Automatic change calculation
- Transaction cancellation
- Product dispensing logic

The controller is implemented as an FSM and verified through simulation using a custom testbench.

This project highlights how real-world control systems can be translated into digital hardware logic.

## ⚙️ Features

- FSM-based control architecture
- 5 selectable products with parameterized pricing
- Coin-based and online payment support
- Automatic change return
- Cancel transaction functionality
- Testbench-driven simulation and verification

---

## 🧠 FSM Design

The controller uses a structured Finite State Machine with the following states:

- IDLE_STATE
- SELECT_PRODUCT_STATE
- Product selection states
- DISPENSE_AND_RETURN_STATE

The FSM ensures correct state transitions for every transaction scenario.
